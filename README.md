A Crop Recommendation System uses machine learning to suggest the best crop based on soil and climate data. It analyzes factors like soil nutrients, pH, rainfall, and temperature. Machine learning models process this data to predict suitable crops. The system helps farmers maximize yield and can be accessed via web or mobile apps for easy recommendations.
